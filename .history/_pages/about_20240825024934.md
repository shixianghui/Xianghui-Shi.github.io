I'm a PhD candidate at [Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn) (BICMR) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn) under the supervision of Professor [Zhiqiang Li](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/lizq/). I received a BS in Mathematics from the Peking University in 2021.

Here is my [CV](../assets/cv_sxh.pdf).
